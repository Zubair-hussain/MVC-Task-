## SEO in React â€“ Overview

React apps are awesome, but when it comes to **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**, they have some quirks.

## ðŸš« Disadvantages of SEO in React:
- Content is rendered **on the client-side**, which search engines may not crawl well.
- Slower initial page load = lower SEO score.
- Meta tags and descriptions aren't easily customizable in plain React.

## âœ… Advantages when solved:
- With frameworks like **Next.js**, you can render React on the server.
- Fast interactive UI once loaded.
- Tools like **React Helmet** can help manage meta info.

React is great â€” but for SEO, we need some extra care ðŸ§ .
