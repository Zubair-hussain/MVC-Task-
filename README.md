# React MVC Project – SEO Content + Movies & Books Example

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern using **React + Vite**.  
It features:

- A Markdown-rendered SEO overview using `react-markdown`
- Advantages & disadvantages of SEO
- MVC folder structure
- Basic use of React Router for navigating between different views like **Movies** and **Books**

---

## ✅ What I’ve Learned

- How to structure a React app using the **MVC pattern**
- How to render Markdown in React using `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`
- Basics of **React Routing** (`react-router-dom`)
- Separation of concerns: Keeping logic (Controller), data (Model), and UI (View) separate
- How to integrate custom content like SEO articles, movies, and books

---

## 🔄 MVC Breakdown

- **Model**: Stores the content (e.g., SEO markdown, movies, books)
- **View**: React components responsible for rendering the UI
- **Controller**: Middle layer that retrieves model data and passes it to views

---

## ✅ Advantages of MVC

- 📁 Clear separation of concerns
- ♻️ Reusable components and logic
- 🔄 Easier to manage and scale large apps
- 🧪 Simplifies testing and debugging

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of MVC

- ⚙️ More setup and boilerplate for smaller apps
- 💡 Might feel overengineered if you're building a very simple SPA
- 🚧 Harder for beginners to grasp initially

---

## 📂 Features Demonstrated

- `react-router-dom` for navigating between:
  - **Home (SEO)**
  - **Movies View**
  - **Books View**

- Markdown content rendering
- Simple reusable components
- Clean file separation based on MVC
